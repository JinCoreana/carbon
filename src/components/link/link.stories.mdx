## Quick Start

Import `Link` into the project.

```javascript
import Link from "carbon-react/lib/components/link";
```

## Designer Notes

To use `Link` with a routing library see our documentation on this here: <LinkTo kind="Documentation/Usage with routing" story="page">Usage with routing</LinkTo>

Avoid using links for commands (performing an action like saving a form) - use them for navigating the user to a new location.
If you’re navigating the user away from your site, consider using an icon after the link, and open the link in a new window, so the user doesn’t lose their place.
To make the meaning of a link clearer, you can add an icon before it. Just name one of the Carbon icons.
Make your link names meaningful - for example, instead of ‘Click here’, try ‘Download Invoice 001’.
WCAG guidelines recommend that Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action. Carbon applies bold weight, but you could also use text decoration.

## Examples

### Default

By default an anchor element will be rendered.

`target` and `rel` props will be passed down to the anchor element when provided.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.DefaultStory}/>
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Setting the `disabled` prop to true disables the link.

**Please note**: To disable an anchor, the `href` prop must not be defined.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with disabled" story={stories.WithDisabled} />
</Canvas>

### Icon

The `icon` prop allows you to render an icon.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with icon" story={stories.WithIcon} />
</Canvas>

#### Icon Align

The `iconAlign` prop allows you to control if the icon renders to left or right of the Link.

**Please note**: To be used only when the `icon` prop is defined.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with iconAlign" story={stories.WithIconAlign} />
</Canvas>

#### Tooltip

By rendering an icon and providing a string to the `tooltipMessage` prop, a tooltip message can be displayed when hovering over the icon.

**Please note**: To be used only when the `icon` prop is defined.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with tooltip" story={stories.WithTooltip} />
</Canvas>

### isSkipLink

`Skip Link` is specific use case for the `Link` component, specifically to enhance keyboard accessibility.
The `Skip Link` has been created to allow users to use keyboard controls to skip over something like a `Menu`.
It allows a user to jump into the main content without going through the whole `Menu` component, button by button.
To show how it works, press the TAB key and you will be able to see how `Skip Link` will displays.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with isSkipLink" story={stories.WithIsSkipLink} />
</Canvas>

### onClick

A custom `onClick` function can be passed to the Link component to render it as a button instead of an anchor.

**Please note**: using the `onClick` prop with no `href` is bad for accessibility, as the output looks like a link but behaves like an HTML button.
If the `onClick` performs an on-page action, so you want a genuine button, please consider using the <LinkTo kind="Button" story="primary">Button component</LinkTo>
instead so that the styles match the semantics. If the `onClick` function performs navigation, an `href` prop is necessary either instead or in addition, so that an
HTML `<a>` tag is used instead. See for example our [React Router docs](?path=/docs/documentation-usage-with-routing--page), where we use `Link` with `onClick` to
perform client-side routing, but still provide the `href` to render an HTML link rather than a button.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with onClick" story={stories.WithOnClick} />
</Canvas>

### variants

Setting the `variant` prop to either `negative` or `neutral` enables overriding of the `default` styling of the `Link` component.
<Canvas>
  <Story name="variants" story={stories.Variants} />
</Canvas>

### On a dark background
 
When the `Link` component is rendered on a dark background, the `isDarkBackground` prop can be used to update the colour styling 
to ensure there is enough contrast. 

<Canvas>
  <Story name="on a dark background" story={stories.OnADarkBackground}/>
</Canvas>

## Props

### Link

<ArgsTable of={Link} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object
to the [i18nProvider](https://carbon.sage.com/?path=/story/documentation-i18n--page).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "link.skipLinkLabel",
      description: "The text to be displayed in skip link",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
