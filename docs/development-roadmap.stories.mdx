## Upcoming activity

Listed below is the activity we have on our backlog.

### TypeScript

We will convert our existing components from JavaScript to TypeScript.
This will reduce errors in our definition files and allow us to leverage TypeScript lanagage features during development.
You can see a detailed plan in the [RFC](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/tree/master/rfcs/text/typescript.md).

### React Testing Library

We will convert our existing tests from Enzyme to React Testing Library. You can see a detailed plain in the [RFC](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/tree/master/rfcs/text/enzyme-to-rtl.md).
This will allow us to upgrade to the latest version of react at a later date.

### Documentation

We will increase our documentation efforts to ensure that our consumers have a good development experience.
We will consider the langauge that we use, the examples that we provide and the tooling that we use.

### Deprecations

Deprecation of components that are no longer actively maintained.

1. ScrollableList
